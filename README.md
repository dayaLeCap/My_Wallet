REQUIREMENTS:

JDK 21: Required to compile and run the project.

PROYECT DESCRIPTION:

This project is a digital wallet application developed in Java that allows
users to register and manage income and expense transactions. 
The application starts with an initial amount of $100. Users can register transactions of type "Sale" or "Buys". 
Each transaction updates the total amount available in the wallet and is saved in a table with a unique ID, 
the transaction date and time, and the corresponding amount.
For this we will use the “Apache NetBeans IDE” application version 21, with the java language, version 21.0.2.

USAGE:

Enter Amount: Input the amount in the "Amount" field.
Select Transaction Type: Click on the "Sale" button for sales or the "Buys" button for purchases.
Register Transaction: The transaction will be recorded in the table, and the available amount will be updated automatically.

EXAMPLE OF USAGE:

Execution 1: SALE

Enter an amount in the "Amount" field.
Click on the "Sale" button.
The application verifies that the entered amount is valid and does not exceed the available amount.
If valid, the available amount is reduced and the transaction is recorded in the table.

Execution 2: BUY

Enter an amount in the "Amount" field.
Click on the "Buys" button.
The application verifies that the entered amount is valid.
If valid, the available amount is increased and the transaction is recorded in the table.

If no amount is entered, the application will show an error message asking for a valid amount.

Execution 4: INVALID NUMBER

If a non-numeric or negative value is entered, the application will show an error message indicating that the amount must be a positive number.
